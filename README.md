# Computer_Graphics
# The project title is Toward a Futuristic Emerald Isle
# application should include the following features:
- The application is implemented in C/C++, using shader-based OpenGL 3.3.
- A minimum frame rate of 15 FPS must be achieved, when running on the latest
generation of GPU (i.e., a desktop 4090). Refer to Lab 4 on how frame rate is
calculated and displayed in the window title.
- The application should demonstrate an infinite scene. The camera should be
controllable (using up, down, left, right keys or mouse buttons). When the camera
moves, the application should simulate an endingless effect, demonstrating that the
camera can move without going out of the scene.
- The application should include the four basic features covered in Lab 1, 2, 3, 4:
geometry rendering, texture mapping, lighting and shadow, and animation.
- The application should allow user interaction and camera-control. User should be
able to move around the scene using the keyboard and/or the mouse. At a minimum,
implement moving forwards and backwards, turning left and turning right.
- The application should include an implementation of one of the following advanced
features that are not discussed in the class. For other features you are welcome to
discuss with the lecturer before implementing them.
o Deferred shading
o Screen-space ambient occlusion
o Screen-space depth of field
o Environment lighting
o Level of details
o Instancing
o Real-time global illumination, e.g., voxel cone tracing
o Physics-based animation, e.g., particle systems, smoothed particle
hydrodynamics
o Support multi-platform graphics: Android/iOS, WebGL, AR/VR.
